# Overlap between ultra-processed food and food that is high in fat, salt or sugar: analysis of the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey
## Introduction
<p>In this repository, we present the summary of calculations for the study on the overlap between ultra-processed food and food that is high in fat, salt or sugar: analysis of the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey, waves 1-11. 
</p>
<p>
Specifically, we have the following objectives: <br><br>
1.1	Classify HFSS foods using the UK Nutrient Databank based on the NPM 2004/5 version. <br>
  <br>
1.2	Classify HFSS foods using the UK Nutrient Databank based on the NPM 2018 revised version. <br>
  <br>
1.3	Classify UPFs using UK Nutrient Databank based on NOVA (available elsewhere). <br>
  <br>
1.4	Quantify the proportion of food and drink items from UK Nutrient Databank data that are:<br>
a)	HFSS (NPM 2004/5)<br>
b)	HFSS (NPM 2018)<br>
c)	UPFs<br>
d)	HFSS (NPM 2004/5) and UPFs<br>
e)	HFSS (NPM 2018) and UPFs<br>
f)	Neither HFSS (NPM 2004/5) nor UPFs<br>
g)	Neither HFSS (NPM 2018) nor UPFs<br><br>
1.5	Quantify the proportion of energy (%kcal)/ weight (grammes) derived from:<br>
a)	HFSS (NPM 2004/5)<br>
b)	HFSS (NPM 2018)<br>
c)	UPFs<br>
d)	HFSS (NPM 2004/5) and UPFs<br>
e)	HFSS (NPM 2018) and UPFs<br>
f)	Neither HFSS (NPM 2004/5) nor UPFs<br>
g)	Neither HFSS (NPM 2018) nor UPFs<br>
<br>
  
1.6	Identify examples of foods and drinks in each group: <br>
a)	HFSS (NPM 2004/5)<br>
b)	HFSS (NPM 2018)<br>
c)	UPFs<br>
d)	HFSS (NPM 2004/5) and UPFs<br>
e)	Neither HFSS (NPM 2004/5) nor UPFs<br>
<br>

1.7	Quantify the weighted relative contribution to total daily energy intake (%kcal/d per person) consumed by NDNS participants in each group:<br>
a)	HFSS (NPM 2004/5)<br>
b)	HFSS (NPM 2018)<br>
c)	UPFs<br>
d)	HFSS (NPM 2004/5) and UPFs<br>
e)	HFSS (NPM 2018) and UPFs<br>
f)	Neither HFSS (NPM 2004/5) nor UPFs<br>
g)	Neither HFSS (NPM 2018) nor UPFs<br>
<br>

1.8	Quantify the weighted relative contribution to total daily weight intake (%g/d per person) consumed by NDNS participants in each group:<br>
a)	HFSS (NPM 2004/5)<br>
b)	HFSS (NPM 2018)<br>
c)	UPFs<br>
d)	HFSS (NPM 2004/5) and UPFs<br>
e)	HFSS (NPM 2018) and UPFs<br>
f)	Neither HFSS (NPM 2004/5) nor UPFs<br>
g)	Neither HFSS (NPM 2018) nor UPFs
